### âœ… **SSE Implementation:**
- Server-Sent Events streams for real-time server-to-client communication
- HTTP POST APIs for client-to-server updates
- EventSource API integration on frontend
- Automatic reconnection handling with 5-second retry logic

**Backend SSE Architecture:**
- `/api/sse/{user_id}` endpoint for individual user streams
- Async queue-based message broadcasting to room participants
- Keep-alive pings every 30 seconds to maintain connections
- Background cleanup task for disconnected users

---

## **Phase 4: Collaboration Features (Day 1)**

### âœ… **Completed Tasks:**

**Real-Time Code Synchronization:**
- Debounced code updates (300ms) to optimize performance
- Broadcast code changes to all room participants via SSE
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution strategy
- User attribution for all code changes

**Multi-User Presence Tracking:**
- Live user list with real-time updates
- User join/leave notifications via SSE
- Connection status monitoring (Connected/Disconnected)
- User session management with automatic cleanup

**Cursor Position Sharing:**
- Real-time cursor position tracking and broadcasting
- Multi-user cursor visualization (backend ready, frontend extensible)
- Position synchronization via SSE streams

**File Operations:**
- Save code to MongoDB with persistence
- Download files with proper extensions based on language
- Reset to language-specific code templates
- Copy Room ID with clipboard API and fallback methods

---

## **Phase 5: Testing & Debugging (Day 1)**

### âœ… **Testing Results:**

**Backend API Testing:**
- Comprehensive test suite with 88.9% success rate (8/9 tests)
- All core APIs functional: room creation, joining, code updates, cursor tracking
- SSE endpoint accessibility verified
- Error handling for invalid room IDs working

**Frontend Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end room creation and joining flow verified
- SSE connection establishment confirmed
- User presence tracking operational  
- Monaco Editor functionality complete

**Critical Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed clipboard permission errors with fallback methods
- Enhanced room joining process with better error handling
- Improved SSE connection debugging and reconnection logic
- Added comprehensive console logging for troubleshooting

---

## **Phase 6: Production Readiness (Day 1)**

## **Key Technical Decisions & Rationale**

### **1. SSE vs WebSocket**
- **Decision**: Server-Sent Events with HTTP APIs
- **Rationale**: Better Kubernetes compatibility, automatic reconnection, simpler implementation
- **Trade-offs**: Unidirectional server-to-client (solved with HTTP POST for client-to-server)

### **2. Debounced Updates**
- **Decision**: 300ms debounce on code changes
- **Rationale**: Optimize performance, reduce API calls, improve user experience
- **Result**: Smooth real-time updates without overwhelming the server

### **3. UUID Room IDs**
- **Decision**: Server-generated UUID room identifiers
- **Rationale**: Unique, secure, database-friendly, URL-safe
- **Alternative**: Human-readable room codes (could be future enhancement)

### **4. MongoDB Schema**
- **Decision**: Document-based storage for rooms and sessions
- **Rationale**: Flexible schema, good for rapid development, handles nested user data well
- **Schema**: Rooms contain code, language, users, metadata
